# Legacy Directory

This directory contains legacy files that are no longer used in the current version.

## Files:

- `run.py` - Legacy runner script (replaced by `python -m src.ielts_monitor`)

## Note:

These files are kept for historical reference but are not used in the current system.

**Use the modern command instead:**
```bash
uv run python -m src.ielts_monitor
```
